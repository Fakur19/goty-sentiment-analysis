## üìà Visualizations & Key Findings
The analysis of over 650,000 user reviews reveals key trends in player sentiment and the aspects they discuss most.

#### Sentiment Trend Over Time
The volume of positive (green) and negative (red) reviews evolves after a game's launch, often peaking initially and fluctuating with sales, updates, or community discourse.

#### Dominant Aspect Proportions
The focus of discussion varies significantly between games. While some are praised for their story, others are discussed more for their difficulty and combat, showcasing unique player priorities for each title.

### Summary of Findings
- While the overall sentiment towards GOTY-winning games is predominantly positive (with a model accuracy of **~89%**), there is significant variance in reception between different titles.
- **Story** and **Gameplay** are the most frequently discussed aspects across all reviews.
- **Positive reviews** often highlight **Story**, **Gameplay**, and **Graphics**.
- **Negative reviews** frequently focus on **Performance** issues (bugs, crashes, optimization) and **Difficulty**.

## üî¨ Methodology Overview

* **Data Source:** User reviews for GOTY winners (2014-2024) were collected from the Steam platform via **web scraping**.
* **Core Model:** Sentiment analysis was performed using the `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
* **Long Text Handling:** A content selection strategy was implemented to process reviews exceeding BERT's 512-token limit by creating a representative summary from the start, middle, and end sections of the original text.
* **Key Analyses:**
    * **Sentiment Classification:** Classifies each review into a binary sentiment (Positive or Negative).
    * **Sentiment Trend Analysis:** Visualizes the volume of positive and negative reviews over time to identify how player perception evolves post-launch.
    * **Dominant Aspect Identification:** Identifies and quantifies the most frequently discussed aspects of the games (e.g., Story, Gameplay, Performance, Difficulty) within positive and negative reviews.
