542695,544215,2023-08-12 13:11:39,Baldur's Gate 3,"There's a lot Larian did well with this, but after playing it for 20~ hours I can confidently say it wasn't ready for release. 



Let me preface this next part - I have a very good computer, far exceeding the recommended:
Poor performance, hitching, frame drops, bad pathing, bad AI for companions/allies, missing textures, crashes, and save destroying bugs come to mind right off the bat. These are all things that needed at least 6 more months of polish, and had no excuse being here in a 1.0 release of a game. 

◘ Loading times are oddly long despite being on a high end SSD. hitching/frame drops are a common occurrence, just as common as seeing a camera change happen (revealing your weird, derpy, over expressive face). 

◘ AI party members make... dubious pathing choices, and get caught on terrain constantly - and allied AI fare ever worse, hucking healing potions at enemies or running through a sea of fire to stare menacingly at an enemy (when a jump would have avoided all damage).

◘ Game objects and textures will sometimes decide that you no longer deserve to observe them, disappearing despite existing mere seconds ago - or in some cases just replacing themselves entirely with a white textureless replica. I had a whole floor to a house disappear once, made navigating it quite a challenge. One time the floating UI for checks ran away, only able to be heard.

◘ The game is mostly stable, but does crash more than it really should. And, though not having experienced this myself yet, there were 2 major save destroying bugs that have been happening to people that have almost a hundred or more hours in. 



Gameplay wise, D&D 5e (and D&D in general) is really a painful base for a game when your DM is an uncompromising inflexible computer, and not your friend Gary who can tweak encounters, checks, story elements, and etc on the fly,  Larian already has compromised with this, and tweaked it heavily to make it more engaging and enjoyable - it still doesn't hold a candle to their last title, Divinity Original Sin 2. 

◘ Combat is, at best, clunky and frustrating. After a few fights, you learn the best option is not to walk - never [i]ever[/i] walk - into any fight. Stop right in your tracks, and spend the next minute preparing your every plan of attack, buff up, start the fight, and then immediately get dinked by an arrow and lose concentration, dropping your expensive buff spell and making all your planning and forethought worthless. But what's the alternative? Walk in and do it mid fight, when the battle has changed and they've exhausted some of their skills and abilities? No, because...

◘ Your action economy sucks. You have 1 action and 1 bonus action. Forget doing a buff and taking advantage of it, because right after your turn 2 people have hit/shot you, one cast grease and you went prone, and another just shoved you. Your buffs are gone, nice wasted turn moron. Ah well, at least you can get a normal hit i- miss. you only had a 55% base chance to hit. Nice wasted turn, double moron. Ok, well you'll use a big level 2 - no, level 3 spell! 55% chance to hit too, and you missed, and that was your only level 3 slot. Also all 8 of them just landed all their hits and your 26hp pool is now 0, because none of your attacks hit or broke concentration on their buffs.

◘ So, if the complete halt in gameplay of buffing and preparing for a minute before walking in, failing miserably, reloading, and doing it all again wasn't bad enough, after nearly each fight you're gonna need a long rest buddy. Load into camp, exhaust the 1 new piece of dialogue from each member, go to bed and watch the cutscene, wake up, leave camp and load back to main map, and [i]now[/i] you can continue your journey. It's such a massive halt to the pacing of the game, constantly fidgeting with long rests and camp. And additionally, with how often you do it and (presumably) how far away you go to do it sometimes, you're wasting a ton of time in a story that has you so narratively pressed for time (in many multiple ways).

◘Shoving and jumping are insane. Jumping is the solution to most problems of distance or of terrain, be it grease, fire, height, or bad pathing around rocks or shrubs. Jumping being a cost of 3m+bonus action means everyone is playing super Mario bros all over Faerûn. Shoving is also a bonus action, which means that your melee character that just waded into 3 casters to pin them down and mess up their casting rolls? They all try to shove you, and they will succeed, and you will be rendered pathetic and displaced. Are you a caster that just put 2 people to sleep? No you didn't, they just got shoved - and then after that they blasted you with spells, nullifying all your work and also damaging you [i]in one turn[/i].



Coming from DoS2, the pacing of gameplay and combat just feels like I'm wading through molasses while being bludgeoned. It's hugely frustrating having a character who's melee, be in the thick of things, not needing to move, and not getting to do anything more because it's a totally separate resource now from actions. - or a caster set up in a good spot casting only 1 spell instead of 3. You get the picture. And I am well aware you get more actions as you go up in level, or you can use speed potions. This doesn't change the core experience greatly, and it sure as hell doesn't change the experience in the first 16~ hours.

Story wise and Character wise? The game is great - Larian knocks it out of the park (except for when they cut to a close up of my mute weirdo, and it looks like he's about to make a cringey marvel quip while listening to someone crying about their lost child). It's just a certain few things about this game are unpolished or are just critically poor choices. And in the interest of keeping this list of problems short, I didn't even list the numerous other small annoyances I had while playing.

547380,548900,2025-03-12 19:57:38,Baldur's Gate 3,"I admit I was pretty late to the excitement of this game from when it initially came out in 2023. A good friend of mine bought me a copy so that we could play this game together, and it did take me a little bit of getting used to. But after enough time playing both by myself and with friends I can say hands down it's not only one of my favorite RPG experiences in recent year, but one of the quintessential PC gaming cornerstone.

As somebody who enjoys both single player experiences and things like tabletop gaming this game easily scratches both those itches and does so with ... one of those, uh... really nice wooden back-scratcher's that's satisfying to use. I know next to little about actual D&D lore, and even without that experience it does a great job at weaving a narrative that's not only easy to digest, but really helps you immerse yourself in the story it tells.

The game-play is a great blend of isometric adventuring and turn based combat, and dances the line between the two really gracefully. Even just beyond the player character, every member of the party you can acquire in the game you can customize to your heart's content to suit what ever manner of play style best suits what you're aiming for.

My biggest reason for wanting to write a review for this game though has to hands down be how wonderful the game's developers at Larian Studios have shown love for the game in it's many many updates. 

Multiplayer is a delight, and even more so the integration of cross platform compatibility AND an active and very sociable modding community whom Larian openly embraces. The togetherness of players and developers is something really rare to see--Even with other modding juggernauts like a lot of Bethesda's RPGs, there isn't such a truly unified community as what gold Larian's struck here.

There have been a few runners-up but they have always stood in the shadow of Bethesdas magnificent epos. After 160 hours of The Witcher 3 the shift has occurred. This is simply put the best role-playing game ever. Ever. Even though the main game doesn’t sport environment and views in the same way the Elder Scrolls series do, it beats said series in narrative. It’s a pure joy to discover all that The Witcher 3 has to offer. On top of that it has excellent gameplay, fun missions and a lot to discover.

Then we have the expansion packs. Hearts of stone sported an excellent story and great missions, but when it comes to Blood and Wine it’s mind blowing. This is the best expansion pack ever and offers an experience like a whole new game. And Toussaint is magnificent when it comes to environment, views and experience. It totally makes up for the main games “not so inspiring” scenes. 

I’m sad to leave Geralt but I feel really fortunate to have spent all this time with him and his adventures. If you only have one game to play, then this is it, but be sure to get the GOTY edition, with the two magnificent expansions that will keep you occupied for a long time.

In games like these, I love playing as a long-ranged class, so of course I chose sorcerer. As a sorcerer, you're pretty much a glass cannon which means you take heavy melee damage. Thankfully, you can unlock the ability to summon spirits and if you manage to find a tanky ally, it really comes in handy.

Just be advised you *WILL* die a lot in this game, especially at the beginning and it's perfectly fine, do not play this game and expect to win straight away. Repetition is key in Elden ring. Think of it as a dark version of LoZ breath of the wild... Learn the bosses/mobs attack patterns and you will eventually prevail. 

If you find yourself struggling with a boss to the point where you're getting one shotted/doing barely any damage, then there's no shame in returning to the previous point and farm runes by killing mobs/exploring dungeons. You can use runes to upgrade your skills, abilities, summons and gear.

231514,232337,2022-03-05 22:40:31,Elden Ring,"First off, Elden Ring has one of the most enjoyable open worlds to explore that I have ever encountered. The game has a vast variety of enemies, bosses, weapons and environments allowing for a very long playthrough and plenty to do.

Many of the bosses are extremely fun with some great cutscenes, fun movesets and excellent music. There are countless dungeons dotted around the world all with their own boss inside. This however is the first problem I had with the game and one that does persist throughout, many of the bosses are recycled with minor differences. 

I won’t spoil anything later in the game, this is from a very early optional dungeon, there is a statue-like boss you can find. It is a rather unusual boss with a strange moveset but is rather fun to fight. A little while later I found another dungeon and the boss inside consisted of another one of those statue-like creatures with a bunch of imps inside. This was a rather unpleasant fight that felt very much like an attempt at artificial difficulty. The imp enemies are fine on their own, fun to fight, but in a small room with a powerful boss at the same time, that wasn’t as enjoyable. It wasn’t too bad though. A while later I found another dungeon with the same statue-like boss yet again however this time there were 2 of them and 1 had a slightly different moveset. Fighting just one of them at this point had become quite easy which Fromsoftware had seemingly become aware of so instead of changing them a bit more, they just add 2. 

I don’t mind boss fights with 2 bosses at once if they are done well. For example, in Dark Souls 1 there were the well known bosses of Ornstein and Smough. Those 2 bosses complimented each other excellently, one was fast and aggressive and the other was slow but powerful. The bosses also tended to only fight one at a time, if you fought Smough, Ornstein would slowly walk towards you for a bit and only would start attacking if you got close or after a certain amount of time. That was a very fair 2 person boss fight. The statue-like bosses in Elden Ring were almost identical and didn’t compliment each other whatsoever. They would both attack at the same time constantly which paired with the fact that their movesets were extremely easy to read at that point meant I just had to keep my distance for ages until they both just did an attack I could punish. That was not an enjoyable 2 person boss fight at all. There were many dungeons as well where the bosses consisted of a normal enemy with a health bar and increased stats with lots of enemies in the boss room. This can be somewhat forgiven though as there are many many dungeons throughout the world so expecting a unique experience from each one is rather silly. Unfortunately this really does highlight a bit of a problem with this game, there is so much content that much of it is lower quality than people would expect. This is just my opinion but I would have preferred if not all dungeons had bosses and instead they just made it so some dungeons have more unique fights.

The world design is mostly fantastic. The beginning area of Limgrave I still believe to be one of the best areas in any open world game. After Limgrave things are still amazing but as the map gets larger, content becomes more and more spread out. That isn’t to say the world is empty, it still feels very full of content, just slightly less so.

The boss fights overall were a mixed bag. Some fights were extremely fun and very memorable, others felt more rushed which makes me feel that Fromsoftware focused more on making a giant world rather than the bosses which is a strange decision from a company known for amazing bosses. Bosses and normal enemies also suffer from very strange balancing problems. Some bosses have next to no health and can die in a few hits however they can also kill you in 1 hit while others are extremely tanky and can also kill you in 1 hit. Due to the open nature of the game, it is rather hard to find out where you are supposed to be at a given time and unfortunately the strange scaling of the enemies adds to that confusion. You might be able to kill the enemies somewhere with ease however the boss can just one shot you with what looks like a lighter attack. This isn’t me saying I found things too hard. I love FromSoftware's previous games and have played Dark Souls 1 and 3 many many times. A lot of bosses seemed to do an extreme amount of damage regardless of how much defence you have. This combined with some of the crazy moves bosses have can lead to some really unfair feeling fights. [spoiler] Near the end of the game you can find the optional boss Malenia, she has a very difficult but fun moveset and a unique mechanic of healing every time she hits you. She heals even if you block her which is a little odd and feels incorrect, but the main problem I have with that fight is what I call her helicopter attack. It is an aerial attack that hits many many times in a very large area and it combos several times. Getting hit by that attack will almost certainly kill you instantly and dodging it felt like it needed luck rather than skill. Even should you choose to block it rather than dodge, it will almost certainly break an ordinary shield and she would heal an incredible amount from it as well. This attack just feels like they didn’t test the fight whatsoever and left it incredibly unbalanced. Aside from that one attack the whole fight is incredible and is still one of my favourites, I just hope they fix it in a patch. [/spoiler]

There are some amazing bosses though, especially later ones where I feel Fromsoftware spent more time on making them fun. 

The story of Elden Ring is similar in how it is told to Dark Souls however it is a little easier to follow. The world has an incredible amount of depth and feels extremely interesting. There are plenty of npc questlines to follow, many of which are extremely enjoyable with an expected depressing conclusion. 

As well as mini dungeons, there are Legacy Dungeons. These are much larger levels that feel more akin to levels from Dark Souls and are usually amazing. For example, the first one players are likely to go to is Stormveil Castle which has some amazing level design and enemy placement and is generally a delight to explore. There are others that end up being more disappointing, such as Raya Lucaria. While the area visually is beautiful, it feels very much like a complicated maze filled with the same enemy, a sorcerer type enemy that fires nonstop magic at you. This area is absolutely full of magic casters making navigating it rather a pain. This isn’t the only area in the game with plenty of magic spam. The game favours having large groups of enemies everywhere as well instead of carefully placed ones which can make a lot of encounters feel quite cheap. [spoiler] Later on in the game you encounter an area called Miquella’s Haligtree, this area is beautiful visually however it contains such a large amount of enemies that exploring it was extremely unpleasant and felt very lazily designed. This is such a shame as the area is a treat to look at and the level design seems so intricate and fun. [/spoiler]

The game also suffers from strange balancing choices with other things. Magic feels very weak. This hopefully will be fixed post launch though with some damage tweaks.

Overall, despite the massive amount of complaints I had about it, I have enjoyed my time with Elden Ring and can genuinely say it is one of my favourite games of all time and will start a second playthrough later on. As Fromsoftware's first attempt at an open world game, they did such an amazing job. I am extremely excited for any dlc this game will have and any future game similar to this as I hope they will learn from the flaws in present within this game. I do really recommend this game though it might be worth waiting a month or 2 for the technical problems to be fixed!

It's like:
First 10 %: Good
Last 10 %: Great (if you have the epilogue-dlc)

The rest is unimaginably tedious and way to long. It feels like they were forced to expand the game to 100 hours no matter how. The pure game mechanics aren't fun. Every fight is the same. Again and again and again. Movement is often fiddly. All menus are made for controller but not in a good way. It's like they wanted you to have no overview at all at no time. 

There are so many indifferent npcs with even more indifferent tedious tasks. At one point I was totally lost and had no idea, why I was doing what I was doing. I mean, my character had no immersive reason to even meet with these people. They were just there and having problems.

The world is huge and filled with a lot of nothing. 90 % of the games lore and story is being presented to you in the form of plain and boring text. There is a reason why there are several mods to increase your characters movement speed. You just don't want to spend so much time running from map-marker 1 to map-marker 2 and so on.

618689,620212,2023-08-06 03:37:20,Baldur's Gate 3,"(EDIT: 32 hours in scroll down to the UPDATE. TLDR full of glitches, bugs, woke messaging and grooming - not safe for children.)
At the two hour mark. Horrifically over-hyped pathetic successor to the original Baldur's Gate games. 
Generic writing. Bland dialog. Linear story with the over used ""you're dying therefore you must"" to force you down a linear path. No actual gameplay to speak of. Dice roll combat pads out the game with reloads since random numbers drive success or failure. Lean on that quick save because you will be reloading and repeating the same garbage over because a goblin went John Wick with lucky shots and one shot your crew. What will you do different? Nothing, the tactical element of Baldur's Gate and Shadows of Amn is gone. Remember how in proper D&D some encounters let you feel like a badass and others humble you? None of that here. You can take on the end boss as a level one because it's just the roll of the dice and if you reload and reroll enough you will win. In large part this is a 5th edition problem. The original game was AD&D aka 2nd edition. It was wonky but it worked. 3rd edition tried to rip off World of Warcraft mechanics and was a disaster. 4th edition tried to fix that. 5th edition is D20, the generic all purpose, no depth role playing system. This game is D20. D20 is boring. This game is boring. 
Endless replayability? How? Why? You're playing through the exact same story beat for beat. There is an overt ""THIS IS THE CORRECT CHOICE AND YOU WILL BE PUNISHED FOR DOING ANYTHING ELSE"" every step of the way. Maybe some unique dialog choices! Okay, I'm only two hours in so maybe in the fifth hour the game opens up? Maybe in the twentieth hour it lets me make a decision that will impact the story, but I'm dubious.
UPDATE 32 Hours In
The whole gaming community is being played for fools. There is a hype bandwagon driven by an agenda at work here claiming this is the quality gamers want - so it sounds pro gamer.
Quality? That is a big fat lie.
I was sneaking through a dungeon, scouting, and opened a door. This prompted the door to go into a quantum state where it was both open and closed at the same time. You could walk through the door, but it blocked line of sight - made the fight that triggered a bit challenging. I've seen dead bodies glitch out so bad they cover the whole map in dead body spaghetti. I've seen goblins with 4 (total) hit points go John Wick and wipe out my entire party in a single turn. The game is far buggier than my experience with Cyberpunk 2077 when that game launched.
Aside from the bugs there are the mechanics. Try to ambush an enemy from hiding? That gives you a single free shot from one character and then your party goes into ""surprised"" and is stun locked for the enemy to get two free turns. Because you aren't supposed to be playing a stealth character. Ranged weapons are OP while melee weapons are pathetically weak - a short bow routinely does more damage than a two handed sword. Oh, and I can not forget to mention the games habit of having your party stumble onto people having s3x and forcing you to watch a cut scene of it. Usually g@y s3x. Because grooming.

great game 
pros

1- the first souls like open world game. which means you have tons of hours to discover.
2-sound effect's are great
3- characters design is brilliant, Japanese inspiration throughout the media is well known for ages. they're just amazing.

cons

1- i dont know sometimes how to connect npc's together for some side missions ..
no mission indicator ! like other open world games i know this is different because i played nioh (1 & 2)
but you really understand where to go and what to do . the game should be friendly on that term. to see things more clearer . and remember it's not like the typical souls games its an open world game so we should have the missions or side missions indicator 
2- the game isn't hard only because of what so called souls game but because you're getting the unbalanced factor . and this is a serious problem for future games by dividing games that way is not a good way to but it in the (souls games ) genre. so anyone in the future can make souls like game by unbalancing the main character and make it weak to the point of only allowed to hunt animals and this is silly.
3- There's no NPC names  that's shameful.
4- should have an option to hide the players messages on the ground.
